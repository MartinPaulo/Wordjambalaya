Wordjambalaya
=============

My first Android project. It is a learning project that simply allows me to cheat on a word game that we have in our local newspaper

# Bugs needing to be fixed (coming soon):
-[ ] Doesn't rotate: I need to examine what happens in rotation.
-[ ] Needs to handle more than three words in possbile answer...

Contains the Ispell (ver 3.1.20) word list. See app/src/main/res/raw/read_me for conditions.
