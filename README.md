Wordjambalaya
=============

My first Android project. It is a learning project that simply allows me to cheat on a word game that we have in our local newspaper

# Bugs needing to be fixed (coming soon):
- [ ] Doesn't handle rotate very well
- [ ] Doesn't select text on word count dialogue properly
- [ ] Word count dialogue should calculate the last word length automatically.

Contains the Ispell (ver 3.1.20) word list. See app/src/main/res/raw/read_me for conditions.
